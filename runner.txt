Gitlab is a server which basically helps you to create the repositories , maintain all the commits and pipelines. 
Gitlab server responsibility is only to check if the runner is accepting the pipeline and executing or not. 

But the moment you create the pipelines, it gives this entire process to gitlab runner , and runner is now responsible to do all the steps metioned for the pipeline, download all the artifacts. 

Scalability: 
We can have as many runners we want. default by gitlab shared runners will be enabled , but. if require we can create our very own runners and deploy on kubernetes


Steps of Runner: 
1. runner starts
2. creates a docker image
3. prepare env insied docker image by cloning repository
4. execute all the commands 
5. will uploads artifacts if there is any 
6. will finish the job by cleaning up , only saved thing will be these logs
